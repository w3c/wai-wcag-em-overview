00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.340
Web accessibility conformance evaluation.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.920
Conformance evaluation determines how well your content meets specific accessibility standards,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.600
such as the "W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines", or "WCAG" for short.

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.860
Often you'll want to do conformance evaluation:

5
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.770
as a final check before releasing a product;

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.580
in order to provide information to potential purchasers of your product;

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.170
to regularly monitor the accessibility
of your website;

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.100
before procuring a product;

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.160
and when getting started with implementing accessibility,

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.400
to get a list of accessibility issues that you need to address.

11
00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.849
To do effective conformance evaluation, you need expertise in:

12
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.598
accessibility standards;

13
00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:53.289
accessible web design and development;

14
00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.280
assistive technologies;

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.670
and in how people with disabilities use the Web.

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.399
You'll probably also want to use evaluation tools to be more efficient.

17
00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.351
"WCAG-EM", the "Website Accessibility Conformance
Evaluation Methodology",

18
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:14.290
provides a structure for your evaluation process.

19
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.520
It describes a process to:

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.350
define the scope of your evaluation;

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.700
explore your website assets;

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.880
select a representative sample of web pages from your website;

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.340
evaluate the selected sample;

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.220
and report your evaluation findings.

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.020
WCAG-EM also recommends involving real users with disabilities during evaluation,

26
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.630
to help you address the real-life experience of your
website users.

27
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.040
The open source WCAG-EM Report Tool helps you follow the methodology,

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.570
record the outcomes, and download a report of your evaluation.

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.960
Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:08.520
